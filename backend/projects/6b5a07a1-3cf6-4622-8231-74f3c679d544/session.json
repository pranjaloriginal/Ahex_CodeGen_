  "requirements": "1. **User Interface Requirements:**\n   - Implement a clean and simple user interface for the to-do list app using React.\n   - Include an input field for users to add new to-do items.\n   - Include a button to submit the new to-do item.\n   - Display the list of current to-do items below the input field.\n   - Provide a way for users to mark to-do items as completed.\n   - Include a delete option for each to-do item to remove it from the list.\n\n2. **Functionality Requirements:**\n   - Enable users to add new to-do items to the list.\n   - Allow users to mark to-do items as completed, which visually distinguishes them from incomplete items (e.g., strikethrough text).\n   - Implement functionality to delete to-do items from the list.\n   - Store the to-do items in local storage so that they persist across page refreshes.\n   - Retrieve to-do items from local storage when the app is loaded.\n\n3. **Local Storage Requirements:**\n   - Ensure that all added to-do items are saved in local storage as an array of objects, where each object contains the to-do item text and its completion status.\n   - On app initialization, check local storage for existing to-do items and load them into the app.\n   - Update local storage whenever a new to-do item is added, marked as completed, or deleted.\n\n4. **Performance Requirements:**\n   - The app should load and render the to-do list items quickly, even if there are many items stored in local storage.\n\n5. **Testing Requirements:**\n   - Write unit tests to ensure the add, complete, and delete functionalities work as expected.\n   - Test that local storage is correctly implemented by checking that data persists between sessions.\n\n6. **Accessibility Requirements:**\n   - Ensure that the app is accessible, including proper labeling of input fields and buttons for screen readers.",
  "tasks": "To implement the requirements for the to-do list app, we can break them down into specific tasks categorized by the type of requirement. Below are the detailed implementation tasks:\n\n### 1. User Interface Requirements\n- **Task 1.1:** Set up a new React project using Create React App or a similar framework.\n- **Task 1.2:** Create a main component for the to-do list app.\n- **Task 1.3:** Design and implement a clean layout for the UI using CSS or a UI framework (e.g., Bootstrap, Material-UI).\n- **Task 1.4:** Add an input field component for users to enter new to-do items.\n- **Task 1.5:** Add a button component for submitting new to-do items.\n- **Task 1.6:** Create a list component to display current to-do items below the input field.\n- **Task 1.7:** Implement a checkbox or button for each to-do item to mark it as completed.\n- **Task 1.8:** Add a delete button for each to-do item to allow users to remove items from the list.\n\n### 2. Functionality Requirements\n- **Task 2.1:** Implement state management within the main component to handle the list of to-do items.\n- **Task 2.2:** Create a function to add new to-do items to the state when the submit button is clicked.\n- **Task 2.3:** Implement a function to toggle the completion status of to-do items (e.g., add a strikethrough style).\n- **Task 2.4:** Create a function to delete to-do items from the state when the delete button is clicked.\n- **Task 2.5:** Ensure that the UI updates dynamically when to-do items are added, completed, or deleted.\n\n### 3. Local Storage Requirements\n- **Task 3.1:** Implement a function to save the to-do items array to local storage whenever an item is added, marked as completed, or deleted.\n- **Task 3.2:** Create a function to retrieve to-do items from local storage and load them into the app when it initializes.\n- **Task 3.3:** Structure the local storage data to store each to-do item as an object with text and completion status.\n\n### 4. Performance Requirements\n- **Task 4.1:** Optimize the rendering process to ensure the app can handle many to-do items efficiently (e.g., consider using React.memo for list items).\n- **Task 4.2:** Test the loading time of the app with a large number of items in local storage to ensure performance is acceptable.\n\n### 5. Testing Requirements\n- **Task 5.1:** Write unit tests using a testing framework (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library) for the add functionality.\n- **Task 5.2:** Write unit tests for the mark as completed functionality to ensure that the UI updates correctly.\n- **Task 5.3:** Write unit tests for the delete functionality to ensure items are removed correctly from both state and local storage.\n- **Task 5.4:** Write tests to verify that data persists in local storage between app sessions.\n\n### 6. Accessibility Requirements\n- **Task 6.1:** Ensure input fields have appropriate `aria-label` attributes for screen readers.\n- **Task 6.2:** Provide keyboard navigation for buttons and input fields to improve usability.\n- **Task 6.3:** Use semantic HTML elements to enhance accessibility (e.g., use `<label>` for input fields).\n- **Task 6.4:** Test the app with accessibility tools (like a screen reader) to ensure compliance with accessibility standards.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n- **Task 7.1:** Document the codebase with comments and README to facilitate future maintenance and onboarding of new developers.\n- **Task 7.2:** Conduct a code review with team members to ensure best practices are followed and gather feedback on the implementation. \n\nBy breaking down the requirements into these tasks, we can systematically implement the to-do list app while ensuring all requirements are met effectively.",
