  "requirements": "1. **Framework**: The application must be built using React.\n\n2. **Functionality**:\n   - Users must be able to add new tasks to the to-do list.\n   - Users must be able to edit existing tasks.\n   - Users must be able to delete tasks from the list.\n   - Users must be able to mark tasks as completed.\n\n3. **Local Storage**:\n   - The app must utilize local storage to save the to-do list data.\n   - The to-do list must persist across page refreshes and browser sessions.\n\n4. **User Interface**:\n   - The UI should include an input field for adding new tasks.\n   - The UI should display a list of current tasks with options to edit, delete, and mark as completed.\n   - The UI should be user-friendly and responsive.\n\n5. **State Management**:\n   - The application should manage the state of the to-do list using React's state management (e.g., useState, useReducer).\n\n6. **Styling**:\n   - Basic styling should be applied to make the application visually appealing.\n\n7. **Documentation**:\n   - Provide clear documentation on how to set up and run the application.",
  "tasks": "To implement the requirements for the to-do list application, we can break down the tasks into specific implementation steps. Here's a structured approach:\n\n### 1. Initialize React Application\n- **Task 1.1**: Set up a new React application using Create React App (CRA).\n- **Task 1.2**: Install necessary dependencies (if any).\n\n### 2. Create Components\n- **Task 2.1**: Create a `TaskInput` component for the input field to add new tasks.\n- **Task 2.2**: Create a `TaskList` component to display the list of tasks.\n- **Task 2.3**: Create a `TaskItem` component to represent each task, including options to edit, delete, and mark as completed.\n\n### 3. Implement Functionality\n- **Task 3.1**: Implement functionality in `TaskInput` to handle user input and add new tasks to the state.\n- **Task 3.2**: Implement functionality in `TaskItem` for editing tasks.\n- **Task 3.3**: Implement functionality in `TaskItem` for deleting tasks.\n- **Task 3.4**: Implement functionality in `TaskItem` to mark tasks as completed (toggle completion status).\n\n### 4. Local Storage Integration\n- **Task 4.1**: Create utility functions to save the to-do list data to local storage.\n- **Task 4.2**: Create utility functions to load the to-do list data from local storage on application start.\n- **Task 4.3**: Ensure that every change to the task list (add, edit, delete, complete) updates local storage accordingly.\n\n### 5. State Management\n- **Task 5.1**: Use React\u2019s `useState` or `useReducer` to manage the state of the to-do list.\n- **Task 5.2**: Ensure state updates trigger re-renders of the UI as necessary.\n\n### 6. User Interface Design\n- **Task 6.1**: Design and implement the layout for the input field and task list.\n- **Task 6.2**: Ensure that the UI is responsive, adjusting for different screen sizes.\n- **Task 6.3**: Enhance user experience with hover effects and clear buttons for edit and delete actions.\n\n### 7. Basic Styling\n- **Task 7.1**: Apply CSS styles to make the application visually appealing (e.g., colors, fonts, spacing).\n- **Task 7.2**: Consider using a CSS framework (like Bootstrap or Material-UI) for quicker styling.\n\n### 8. Documentation\n- **Task 8.1**: Write a README file with instructions on how to set up the application.\n- **Task 8.2**: Include details on how to run the application locally, any necessary environment variables, and a brief overview of the application structure.\n\n### 9. Testing (Optional but Recommended)\n- **Task 9.1**: Write unit tests for key components and functionalities (using Jest and React Testing Library).\n- **Task 9.2**: Test the application across different browsers to ensure compatibility.\n\n### 10. Deployment (Optional)\n- **Task 10.1**: Choose a deployment platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).\n- **Task 10.2**: Deploy the application and ensure it's accessible online.\n\nThis breakdown provides a clear roadmap for developing the to-do list application while addressing all requirements stated. Each task can be further detailed or adjusted based on the development team's workflow and preferences.",
