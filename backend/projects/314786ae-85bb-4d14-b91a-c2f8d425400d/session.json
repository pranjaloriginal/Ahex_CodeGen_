  "requirements": "1. **Framework**: The application must be built using React.\n\n2. **Functionality**:\n   - Users should be able to add new tasks to the to-do list.\n   - Users should be able to edit existing tasks.\n   - Users should be able to delete tasks from the to-do list.\n   - Users should be able to mark tasks as completed.\n\n3. **Local Storage**:\n   - The application must utilize local storage to persist the to-do list data.\n   - When the application is reopened, it should retrieve and display the saved to-do list from local storage.\n\n4. **User Interface**:\n   - The app should have a clear input field for adding new tasks.\n   - There should be a button to submit the new task.\n   - Each task should be displayed in a list format with options to edit and delete.\n   - Completed tasks should be visually distinguishable from incomplete tasks (e.g., through strikethrough text or different color).\n\n5. **Responsiveness**: The application should be responsive and function properly on different screen sizes.\n\n6. **Error Handling**: The application should handle errors gracefully (e.g., preventing the addition of empty tasks).\n\n7. **Testing**: The application should be tested to ensure all functionalities work as expected.\n\n8. **Documentation**: Provide basic documentation on how to set up and run the application.",
  "tasks": "To implement the requirements for the to-do list application using React, we can break down the requirements into specific tasks as follows:\n\n### 1. Framework Setup\n- **Task 1.1**: Set up a new React project using Create React App or a similar tool.\n- **Task 1.2**: Ensure the project structure is organized (e.g., separate folders for components, styles, and utilities).\n\n### 2. Functionality Implementation\n- **Task 2.1**: Implement the functionality to add new tasks.\n  - Create an input field and a button for submitting tasks.\n  - Write a function to handle the submission and update the state with the new task.\n  \n- **Task 2.2**: Implement the functionality to edit existing tasks.\n  - Create an edit button next to each task and a way to change the task text.\n  - Write a function to update the task in the state.\n  \n- **Task 2.3**: Implement the functionality to delete tasks.\n  - Add a delete button for each task entry.\n  - Write a function to remove the task from the state.\n  \n- **Task 2.4**: Implement the functionality to mark tasks as completed.\n  - Add a checkbox or button to toggle the completed state of each task.\n  - Write a function to update the task's completion status in the state.\n\n### 3. Local Storage Integration\n- **Task 3.1**: Implement local storage functionality to save the to-do list.\n  - Write functions to save the task list to local storage whenever it changes.\n  \n- **Task 3.2**: Implement data retrieval from local storage on application load.\n  - Use `useEffect` to load tasks from local storage when the app is first opened.\n\n### 4. User Interface Design\n- **Task 4.1**: Design the input field for adding new tasks.\n  - Style the input field and button for a clean user experience.\n  \n- **Task 4.2**: Design the task list display.\n  - Create a component to display tasks in a list format.\n  \n- **Task 4.3**: Differentiate completed tasks visually.\n  - Apply conditional styling (e.g., strikethrough or color change) for completed tasks.\n\n### 5. Responsiveness\n- **Task 5.1**: Implement responsive design principles for the layout.\n  - Use CSS media queries or a responsive design library to ensure it looks good on various screen sizes.\n\n### 6. Error Handling\n- **Task 6.1**: Implement validation to prevent adding empty tasks.\n  - Show an error message or disable the submit button if the input is empty.\n\n### 7. Testing\n- **Task 7.1**: Write unit tests for each functionality (adding, editing, deleting, completing tasks).\n- **Task 7.2**: Use a testing library (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library) to ensure that all components and functionalities work as expected.\n\n### 8. Documentation\n- **Task 8.1**: Create a README file with setup instructions.\n  - Include prerequisites, installation steps, and how to run the application.\n  \n- **Task 8.2**: Document any important code files or components for clarity.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n- **Task 9.1**: Version control: Initialize a git repository and commit changes regularly.\n- **Task 9.2**: Performance optimization: Review and optimize code and component rendering if necessary.\n\nBy breaking down the requirements into these tasks, you can systematically approach the development of the to-do list application, ensuring that all aspects of the requirements are covered.",
