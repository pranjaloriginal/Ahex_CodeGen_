  "requirements": "1. **Technology Stack**: The application must be developed using React.\n\n2. **Core Functionality**:\n   - The application should allow users to create, read, update, and delete to-do items.\n   - Users should be able to mark to-do items as completed.\n\n3. **Local Storage**:\n   - The app must utilize local storage to persist to-do items so that they remain available after the page is refreshed.\n   - On application load, the app should retrieve existing to-do items from local storage and display them.\n\n4. **User Interface**:\n   - Provide an input field for users to add new to-do items.\n   - Display a list of to-do items with options to edit or delete each item.\n   - Include a checkbox or similar UI element for marking items as completed.\n\n5. **State Management**:\n   - Use React state to manage the current list of to-do items and their completion status.\n\n6. **Responsiveness**:\n   - The app should be responsive and usable on both desktop and mobile devices.\n\n7. **Accessibility**:\n   - Ensure the app is accessible, including proper labeling of form elements and buttons.\n\n8. **Styling**:\n   - Implement basic styling to ensure the app is visually appealing and user-friendly. \n\n9. **Error Handling**:\n   - Include error handling for user inputs (e.g., prevent empty to-do items from being added). \n\n10. **Testing**:\n    - Develop unit tests for core functionalities, such as adding, editing, and deleting to-do items.\n\n11. **Documentation**:\n    - Provide clear documentation on how to set up and run the application, including any dependencies.",
  "tasks": "Here\u2019s a breakdown of the requirements into implementation tasks for building the to-do application using React:\n\n### 1. **Technology Stack**\n   - Set up a new React project using Create React App or a similar setup.\n\n### 2. **Core Functionality**\n   - **Task 2.1**: Implement CRUD operations for to-do items.\n     - Create a function to add a new to-do item.\n     - Create a function to read/display to-do items.\n     - Create a function to update an existing to-do item.\n     - Create a function to delete a to-do item.\n   - **Task 2.2**: Implement functionality to mark to-do items as completed.\n\n### 3. **Local Storage**\n   - **Task 3.1**: Create functions to save to-do items to local storage.\n   - **Task 3.2**: Create functions to retrieve to-do items from local storage on application load.\n\n### 4. **User Interface**\n   - **Task 4.1**: Design and implement an input field for adding new to-do items.\n   - **Task 4.2**: Create and style a list to display existing to-do items.\n   - **Task 4.3**: Add edit and delete buttons for each to-do item.\n   - **Task 4.4**: Implement a checkbox or toggle for marking items as completed.\n\n### 5. **State Management**\n   - **Task 5.1**: Use React state to manage the list of to-do items and their completion status.\n   - **Task 5.2**: Ensure state updates trigger re-rendering of the UI.\n\n### 6. **Responsiveness**\n   - **Task 6.1**: Use CSS media queries or a framework (like Bootstrap or Material-UI) to ensure the app is responsive.\n   - **Task 6.2**: Test the application on different screen sizes (desktop and mobile).\n\n### 7. **Accessibility**\n   - **Task 7.1**: Ensure all form elements have appropriate labels.\n   - **Task 7.2**: Implement keyboard navigation and ARIA roles where necessary.\n\n### 8. **Styling**\n   - **Task 8.1**: Create a CSS file or use a CSS-in-JS solution to style the application.\n   - **Task 8.2**: Define styles for the input field, buttons, list items, and completed states.\n\n### 9. **Error Handling**\n   - **Task 9.1**: Implement validation to prevent empty to-do items from being added.\n   - **Task 9.2**: Display error messages or warnings to users when validation fails.\n\n### 10. **Testing**\n   - **Task 10.1**: Set up a testing framework (e.g., Jest and React Testing Library).\n   - **Task 10.2**: Write unit tests for:\n     - Adding new to-do items.\n     - Editing existing to-do items.\n     - Deleting to-do items.\n     - Marking items as completed.\n\n### 11. **Documentation**\n   - **Task 11.1**: Create a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the application.\n   - **Task 11.2**: Document any dependencies and how to install them.\n   - **Task 11.3**: Include usage examples or screenshots if applicable.\n\n### Additional Tasks\n- **Task 12.1**: Review and refactor code for optimization and best practices.\n- **Task 12.2**: Conduct user testing to gather feedback on usability and make necessary adjustments.\n\nThis breakdown will help in organizing the development process and ensuring all requirements are met systematically.",
