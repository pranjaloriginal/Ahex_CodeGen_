  "requirements": "1. **Technology Stack**: The application must be built using React.\n\n2. **Functionality**:\n   - The app should allow users to add new to-do items.\n   - Users must be able to mark to-do items as completed.\n   - Users should be able to delete to-do items.\n\n3. **Local Storage**:\n   - The app must use local storage to save to-do items so that they persist even after a page refresh.\n   - On app initialization, the to-do list should load items from local storage.\n\n4. **User Interface**:\n   - Provide input fields for users to enter new to-do items.\n   - Display the list of to-do items in a user-friendly format.\n   - Include visual indicators for completed and pending tasks (e.g., strikethrough for completed tasks).\n\n5. **Accessibility**:\n   - Ensure that the app is accessible, following best practices for usability.\n\n6. **Styling**:\n   - The app should have a clean and simple design, ensuring a good user experience.\n\n7. **Testing**:\n   - Implement basic testing to verify that adding, completing, and deleting tasks work as expected.\n\nWith these requirements, developers will be able to create a functional and user-friendly to-do list application using React and local storage.",
  "tasks": "To implement the requirements for the to-do list application using React and local storage, we can break them down into specific tasks as follows:\n\n### 1. **Setup Project**\n   - **Task 1.1**: Initialize a new React project using Create React App or a similar setup.\n   - **Task 1.2**: Install any necessary dependencies (if needed).\n\n### 2. **Technology Stack**\n   - **Task 2.1**: Ensure the project is configured to use React.\n\n### 3. **Functionality**\n   - **Task 3.1**: Create a component for adding new to-do items.\n       - Implement an input field and a button to submit the new item.\n   - **Task 3.2**: Implement state management for the to-do list using React's useState or a state management library.\n   - **Task 3.3**: Create a function to handle the addition of new to-do items.\n   - **Task 3.4**: Create a function to mark to-do items as completed.\n       - Update the state to reflect the completion status.\n   - **Task 3.5**: Create a function to delete to-do items.\n       - Update the state to remove the selected item.\n\n### 4. **Local Storage**\n   - **Task 4.1**: Implement functions to save to-do items to local storage whenever they are added, marked as completed, or deleted.\n   - **Task 4.2**: On app initialization, create a function to load to-do items from local storage and populate the state.\n\n### 5. **User Interface**\n   - **Task 5.1**: Design and implement the layout for the input field and the to-do list display.\n   - **Task 5.2**: Render the list of to-do items in a user-friendly format using a map function.\n   - **Task 5.3**: Add visual indicators (e.g., strikethrough CSS) to show the status of completed tasks.\n\n### 6. **Accessibility**\n   - **Task 6.1**: Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, input fields) are keyboard accessible.\n   - **Task 6.2**: Add appropriate ARIA labels and roles where necessary.\n   - **Task 6.3**: Ensure color contrast ratios meet accessibility standards.\n\n### 7. **Styling**\n   - **Task 7.1**: Create a CSS file or use styled-components to style the application.\n   - **Task 7.2**: Implement a clean and simple design for the application.\n   - **Task 7.3**: Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes.\n\n### 8. **Testing**\n   - **Task 8.1**: Set up a testing framework (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library).\n   - **Task 8.2**: Write unit tests for the functions that add, complete, and delete tasks.\n   - **Task 8.3**: Write integration tests to ensure the UI behaves as expected with state changes.\n\n### 9. **Documentation**\n   - **Task 9.1**: Write documentation for the project setup and usage.\n   - **Task 9.2**: Comment code where necessary for clarity.\n\n### 10. **Deployment**\n   - **Task 10.1**: Prepare the application for deployment.\n   - **Task 10.2**: Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) and deploy the application.\n\nBy breaking down the requirements into these implementation tasks, developers can systematically tackle each aspect of the to-do list application, ensuring that all requirements are met effectively.",
